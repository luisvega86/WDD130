    <h2>Luis Alfredo Vega</h2>
    <p>Hi guys! I am Luis ALfredo. I'm from Venezuela but living in Mar del Plata, 
    Argentina since 2016. I'm looking to get a degree in Aplied Technology. 
    I love video games, rock music and food. I'm married to Maria Magdalena for 
    almost 8 years now and we have a beautiful daughter Paula Antonella and expecting 
    for a new princess by July. Sooner in my life I was loking for a career in Architecture, 
    but migration made it harder and i had to stop. Later a friend told me about Pathway Connect 
    and I started this path. I find this course useful because it's the front-end of what we are 
    learning as programmers. Is the visible part of the art of coding. I've been member of the 
    Church since 2009, served a mission in Caracas, Venezuela between 2011-2013. I speak Spanish, 
    English and Russian.</p>
